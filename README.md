# Task-Flow
Task Flow is a full stack task and project manager built as a modern monorepo. It includes a Fastify + Prisma + Postgres API with JWT auth, health/docs endpoints, and seeded demo data, plus a Next.js web app for login, dashboards, projects, and tasks. Tested, typed, linted, and docker-ready. Great for showcasing real world workflows and clean DX.
